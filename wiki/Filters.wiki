=Introduction=
Each filter exists to process audio, with the exception of the OSC Pass-through filter, which has its own page [OSCPassThrough here].

=Filters=

===Bandpass===

A bandpass filter passes a narrow band of audio around its cutoff frequency, which is specified by user touch input.

===Bandstop===

A bandstop silences a narrow band of audio around its cutoff frequency, which is specified by user touch input.

===Bass Wobbler===

The Bass Wobbler applies dubstep-style wobble to low frequency audio by modulating the cutoff frequency of a [Filters#Lowpass lowpass] filter between 10 and 220 hz on a triangle wave. The speed of the modulation is specified by user touch input.

===Highpass===

A Highpass filter passes audio with frequency higher than its cutoff frequency, which is specified by user touch input.

===Lowpass===

A lowpass filter passes audio with frequency lower than its cutoff frequency, which is specified by user touch input.

===Tremelo===

The tremolo filter modulates the [Filters#Volume volume] of the audio between 0db and parity on a sine wave. The speed of the modulation is specified by user touch input.

===Volume===

The volume filter manipulates the volume of the audio between 0db and 1.275 times parity (light amplification), with the level specified by user touch input.
